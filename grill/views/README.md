The `grill.views` package provides `Qt` widgets to author and inspect `USD` scene graphs.

The main focus is for these to help comprehend the composed scene graph in a more interactive manner.
What question do we want to ask?

Convenience launchers and menus for **USDView**, **Houdini** and **Maya** are provided (appearing under the `👨‍🍳 Grill` menu), but any DCC or environment with `USD` and `PySide2` should be able to use the widgets.
