The `grill.views` package provides `Qt` widgets to author and inspect `USD` content.

Convenience launchers and menus for **USDView**, **Houdini** and **Maya** are provided (appearing under the `👨‍🍳 Grill` menu), but any DCC or environment with `USD` and `PySide(2|6)` should be able to use the widgets.
